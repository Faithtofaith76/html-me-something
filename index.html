<h1><strong>MY ROAD TO MUSCLES</strong></h1>
<article>
<p>Serina Williams.  Yes, Serina Williams,<br>
    one of the best athletes in the 
    world inspired me to make <br>
    better health choices.  I would see<br> 
    how her muscle complimented the 
    attributes that women in our <br>
    races are known for.  Attributes 
    that are now being used </br>
    as a blueprint to a better body 
    per plastic surgeons.</p>
